# Genetic-Algorithms-for-Cloud-task-scheduling-in-Python
Here is an implementation of a modified genetic algorithm for cloud task scheduling based on a paper, as part of my class assignment. 

I have also implemented 3 other algorithms: Round Robin, First comes first serve and shortest job first.
The comparison is made by plotting the resluts in an interactive plot.

The main changes applied to our classis simple genetic algorithm is:
- generating population based on two algorithms
- using two-point crossover and mutation


I may soon create another repository implementing other Evolutionary Algorithms such as Ant Colony.
